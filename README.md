## Fantasy Premier League

A.K.A **FPL** in short, it is a game in which participants assemble an imaginary team of real life footballers for a gameweek in the **English Premier League** and score points based on those players' actual statistical performance or their perceived contribution on the field of play. It requires predicting and foreseeing the future of the players' performance.  

## The fpl_AI Bot

* It gives suggestions based on insights on what steps to take to maximize the FPL team points.  
* It makes the suggestions for player transfer if needed based on:
  * upcoming fixtures
  * players' form
  * team budget
* It sends the suggestions or advice automatically via email a few hours before the FPL Gameweek deadline.
